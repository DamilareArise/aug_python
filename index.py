# python varaibles
# variables are symbolic names that acts as containers for storing values
# i. variable name
# ii. assignment operation (funnel)
# iii. value
box = "cloths"
box = "Water"
# print(box)

# Rules guiding python variable declarations
# 1. You don't start a variable name with any symbols aside _ or alphabet
# 2. You don't include spaces during variable declaration. You use either camel casing, pascal casing or snake casing 
# 3. You don't use python's special keywords
# 4. your varaible name should be descriptive enough 


first_name = 'Damilare' # snake casing
FirstName = 'Damilare' # pascal casing
firstName = 'Damilare' # Camel casing

# types of variable declaration
# 1. single variable single value
first_name = 'Damilare'

# 2. single variable multiple values
students = 'raji', 'precious', 'emmanuel'
# print(students)

# 3. multiple variable single value 
x = y = z = 10
# print(z)
# z = z + 2
# print(x)

# 4. multiple variables multiple values
# x, y, z = 10, 11, 12
# print(z)


# Dynamic variable
name = input('Your name: ')
age = input('Age: ')
dept = input("Department: ")
# print(name)

# Concatenation -> joining two strings together
# print("I am " + "Happy " + "100")

# print("Welcome",100)
# print("My name is "+name+" I am "+age+"Years old. I am in the department of "+dept+". Thank you")

# f-string 
print(f"My name {name}, I am {age}years old. I am in the department of {dept}. Thank you.")
